<blockquote>

<p>Dans la trêve désolée de cette matinée, ces
hommes qui avaient été tenaillés par la fatigue,
fouettés par la pluie, bouleversés par toute une
nuit de tonnerre, ces rescapés des volcans et de
l'inondation entrevoyaient à quel point la guerre,
aussi hideuse au moral qu'au physique, non seulement
viole le bon sens, avilit les grandes idées,
commande tous les crimes&mdash;mais ils se rappelaient
combien elle avait développé en eux et autour d'eux
tous les mauvais instincts sans en excepter un seul;
la méchanceté jusqu'au sadisme, l'égoïsme jusqu'à
la férocité, le besoin de jouir jusqu'à la folie.</p>

<br />
<br />
Dim, gradual thinning of the shapeless gloom<br />
Shudders to drizzling daybreak that reveals<br />
Disconsolate men who stamp their sodden boots<br />
And turn dulled, sunken faces to the sky<br />
Haggard and hopeless. They, who have beaten down<br />
The stale despair of night, must now renew<br />
Their desolation in the truce of dawn,<br />
Murdering the livid hours that grope for peace.<br />
<br />
Yet these, who cling to life with stubborn hands,<br />
Can grin through storms of death and find a gap<br />
In the clawed, cruel tangles of his defence.<br />
They march from safety, and the bird-sung joy<br />
Of grass-green thickets, to the land where all<br />
Is ruin, and nothing blossoms but the sky<br />
That hastens over them where they endure<br />
Sad, smoking, flat horizons, reeking woods,<br />
And foundered trench-lines volleying doom for doom.<br />
<br />
O my brave brown companions, when your souls<br />
Flock silently away, and the eyeless dead<br />
Shame the wild beast of battle on the ridge,<br />
Death will stand grieving in that field of war<br />
Since your unvanquished hardihood is spent.<br />
And through some mooned Valhalla there will pass<br />
Battalions and battalions, scarred from hell;<br />
The unreturning army that was youth;<br />
The legions who have suffered and are dust.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="DREAMERS"></a>DREAMERS<br />
<br />
<br />
Soldiers are citizens of death's gray land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drawing no dividend from time's to-morrows;</span><br />
In the great hour of destiny they stand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each with his feuds, and jealousies, and sorrows.</span><br />
Soldiers are sworn to action; they must win<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some flaming, fatal climax with their lives.</span><br />
Soldiers are dreamers; when the guns begin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They think of firelit homes, clean beds, and wives.</span><br />
<br />
I see them in foul dug-outs, gnawed by rats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the ruined trenches, lashed with rain,</span><br />
Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mocked by hopeless longing to regain</span><br />
Bank-holidays, and picture shows, and spats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And going to the office in the train.</span><br />

<a id="THE_REDEEMER"></a>THE REDEEMER<br />
<br />
<br />
Darkness: the rain sluiced down; the mire was deep;<br />
It was past twelve on a mid-winter night,<br />
When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep:<br />
There, with much work to do before the light,<br />
We lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we might<br />
Along the trench; sometimes a bullet sang,<br />
And droning shells burst with a hollow bang;<br />
We were soaked, chilled and wretched, every one.<br />
Darkness: the distant wink of a huge gun.<br />
<br />
I turned in the black ditch, loathing the storm;<br />
A rocket fizzed and burned with blanching flare,<br />
And lit the face of what had been a form<br />
Floundering in mirk. He stood before me there;<br />
I say that he was Christ; stiff in the glare,<br />
And leaning forward from his burdening task,<br />
Both arms supporting it; his eyes on mine<br />
Stared from the woeful head that seemed a mask<br />
Of mortal pain in Hell's unholy shine.<br />
<br />
No thorny crown, only a woollen cap<br />
He wore&mdash;an English soldier, white and strong,<br />
Who loved his time like any simple chap,<br />
Good days of work and sport and homely song;<br />
Now he has learned that nights are very long,<br />
And dawn a watching of the windowed sky.<br />
But to the end, unjudging, he'll endure<br />
Horror and pain, not uncontent to die<br />
That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure.<br />
<br />
He faced me, reeling in his weariness,<br />
Shouldering his load of planks, so hard to bear.<br />
I say that he was Christ, who wrought to bless<br />
All groping things with freedom bright as air,<br />
And with His mercy washed and made them fair.<br />
Then the flame sank, and all grew black as pitch,<br />
While we began to struggle along the ditch;<br />
And some one flung his burden in the muck,<br />
Mumbling: "O Christ Almighty, now I'm stuck!"<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="TRENCH_DUTY"></a>TRENCH DUTY<br />
<br />
Shaken from sleep, and numbed and scarce awake,<br />
Out in the trench with three hours' watch to take,<br />
I blunder through the splashing mirk; and then<br />
Hear the gruff muttering voices of the men<br />
Crouching in cabins candle-chinked with light.<br />
Hark! There's the big bombardment on our right<br />
Rumbling and bumping; and the dark's a glare<br />
Of flickering horror in the sectors where<br />
We raid the Boche; men waiting, stiff and chilled,<br />
Or crawling on their bellies through the wire.<br />
"What? Stretcher-bearers wanted? Some one killed?"<br />
Five minutes ago I heard a sniper fire:<br />
Why did he do it?... Starlight overhead&mdash;<br />
Blank stars. I'm wide-awake; and some chap's dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="WIRERS"></a>WIRERS<br />
<br />
<br />
"Pass it along, the wiring party's going out"&mdash;<br />
And yawning sentries mumble, "Wirers going out."<br />
Unravelling; twisting; hammering stakes with muffled thud,<br />
They toil with stealthy haste and anger in their blood.<br />
<br />
The Boche sends up a flare. Black forms stand rigid there,<br />
Stock-still like posts; then darkness, and the clumsy ghosts<br />
Stride hither and thither, whispering, tripped by clutching snare<br />
Of snags and tangles.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Ghastly dawn with vaporous coasts</span><br />
Gleams desolate along the sky, night's misery ended.<br />
<br />
Young Hughes was badly hit; I heard him carried away,<br />
Moaning at every lurch; no doubt he'll die to-day.<br />
But <i>we</i> can say the front-line wire's been safely mended.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="BREAK_OF_DAY"></a>BREAK OF DAY<br />
<br />
<br />
There seemed a smell of autumn in the air<br />
At the bleak end of night; he shivered there<br />
In a dank, musty dug-out where he lay,<br />
Legs wrapped in sand-bags,&mdash;lumps of chalk and clay<br />
Spattering his face. Dry-mouthed, he thought, "To-day<br />
We start the damned attack; and, Lord knows why,<br />
Zero's at nine; how bloody if I'm done in<br />
Under the freedom of that morning sky!"<br />
And then he coughed and dozed, cursing the din.<br />
<br />
Was it the ghost of autumn in that smell<br />
Of underground, or God's blank heart grown kind,<br />
That sent a happy dream to him in hell?&mdash;<br />
Where men are crushed like clods, and crawl to find<br />
Some crater for their wretchedness; who lie<br />
In outcast immolation, doomed to die<br />
Far from clean things or any hope of cheer,<br />
Cowed anger in their eyes, till darkness brims<br />
And roars into their heads, and they can hear<br />
Old childish talk, and tags of foolish hymns.<br />
<br />
He sniffs the chilly air; (his dreaming starts).<br />
He's riding in a dusty Sussex lane<br />
In quiet September; slowly night departs;<br />
And he's a living soul, absolved from pain.<br />
Beyond the brambled fences where he goes<br />
Are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves,<br />
And tree-tops dark against the stars grown pale;<br />
Then, clear and shrill, a distant farm-cock crows;<br />
And there's a wall of mist along the vale<br />
Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves.<br />
He gazes on it all, and scarce believes<br />
That earth is telling its old peaceful tale;<br />
He thanks the blessed world that he was born ...<br />
Then, far away, a lonely note of the horn.<br />
<br />
They're drawing the Big Wood! Unlatch the gate,<br />
And set Golumpus going on the grass:<br />
<i>He</i> knows the corner where it's best to wait<br />
And hear the crashing woodland chorus pass;<br />
The corner where old foxes make their track<br />
To the Long Spinney; that's the place to be.<br />
The bracken shakes below an ivied tree,<br />
And then a cub looks out; and "Tally-o-back!"<br />
He bawls, and swings his thong with volleying crack,&mdash;<br />
All the clean thrill of autumn in his blood,<br />
And hunting surging through him like a flood<br />
In joyous welcome from the untroubled past;<br />
While the war drifts away, forgotten at last.<br />
<br />
Now a red, sleepy sun above the rim<br />
Of twilight stares along the quiet weald,<br />
And the kind, simple country shines revealed<br />
In solitudes of peace, no longer dim.<br />
The old horse lifts his face and thanks the light,<br />
Then stretches down his head to crop the green.<br />
All things that he has loved are in his sight;<br />
The places where his happiness has been<br />
Are in his eyes, his heart, and they are good.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">* * * * *</span><br />

<a id="A_WORKING_PARTY"></a>A WORKING PARTY<br />
<br />
<br />
Three hours ago he blundered up the trench,<br />
Sliding and poising, groping with his boots;<br />
Sometimes he tripped and lurched against the walls<br />
With hands that pawed the sodden bags of chalk.<br />
He couldn't see the man who walked in front;<br />
Only he heard the drum and rattle of feet<br />
Stepping along the trench-boards,&mdash;often splashing<br />
Wretchedly where the sludge was ankle-deep.<br />
<br />
Voices would grunt, "Keep to your right,&mdash;make way!"<br />
When squeezing past the men from the front-line:<br />
White faces peered, puffing a point of red;<br />
Candles and braziers glinted through the chinks<br />
And curtain-flaps of dug-outs; then the gloom<br />
Swallowed his sense of sight; he stooped and swore<br />
Because a sagging wire had caught his neck.<br />
A flare went up; the shining whiteness spread<br />
And flickered upward, showing nimble rats,<br />
And mounds of glimmering sand-bags, bleached with rain;<br />
Then the slow, silver moment died in dark.<br />
<br />
The wind came posting by with chilly gusts<br />
And buffeting at corners, piping thin<br />
And dreary through the crannies; rifle-shots<br />
Would split and crack and sing along the night,<br />
And shells came calmly through the drizzling air<br />
To burst with hollow bang below the hill.<br />
<br />
Three hours ago he stumbled up the trench;<br />
Now he will never walk that road again:<br />
He must be carried back, a jolting lump<br />
Beyond all need of tenderness and care;<br />
A nine-stone corpse with nothing more to do.<br />
<br />
He was a young man with a meagre wife<br />
And two pale children in a Midland town;<br />
He showed the photograph to all his mates;<br />
And they considered him a decent chap<br />
Who did his work and hadn't much to say,<br />
And always laughed at other people's jokes<br />
Because he hadn't any of his own.<br />
<br />
That night, when he was busy at his job<br />
Of piling bags along the parapet,<br />
He thought how slow time went, stamping his feet,<br />
And blowing on his fingers, pinched with cold.<br />
<br />
He thought of getting back by half-past twelve,<br />
And tot of rum to send him warm to sleep,<br />
In draughty dug-out frowsty with the fumes<br />
Of coke, and full of snoring, weary men.<br />
<br />
He pushed another bag along the top,<br />
Craning his body outward; then a flare<br />
Gave one white glimpse of No Man's Land and wire;<br />
And as he dropped his head the instant split<br />
His startled life with lead, and all went out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="STAND-TO_GOOD_FRIDAY_MORNING"></a>STAND-TO: GOOD FRIDAY MORNING<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd been on duty from two till four.<br />
I went and stared at the dug-out door.<br />
Down in the frowst I heard them snore.<br />
"Stand-to!" Somebody grunted and swore.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dawn was misty; the skies were still;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Larks were singing, discordant, shrill;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>They</i> seemed happy; but <i>I</i> felt ill.</span><br />
Deep in water I splashed my way<br />
Up the trench to our bogged front line.<br />
Rain had fallen the whole damned night.<br />
O  Jesus, send me a wound to-day,<br />
And I'll believe in Your bread and wine,<br />
And get my bloody old sins washed white!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IN_THE_PINK"></a>IN THE PINK<br />
<br />
<br />
So Davies wrote: "This leaves me in the pink."<br />
Then scrawled his name: "Your loving sweetheart, Willie."<br />
With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink<br />
Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly,<br />
For once his blood ran warm; he had pay to spend.<br />
Winter was passing; soon the year would mend.<br />
<br />
He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark<br />
He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm,<br />
When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark<br />
In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm<br />
With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear<br />
The simple, silly things she liked to hear.<br />
<br />
And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge<br />
Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten.<br />
Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge,<br />
And everything but wretchedness forgotten.<br />
To-night he's in the pink; but soon he'll die.<br />
And still the war goes on; <i>he</i> don't know why.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
"Jack fell as he'd have wished," the Mother said,<br />
And folded up the letter that she'd read.<br />
"The Colonel writes so nicely." Something broke<br />
In the tired voice that quavered to a choke.<br />
She half looked up. "We mothers are so proud<br />
Of our dead soldiers." Then her face was bowed.<br />
<br />
Quietly the Brother Officer went out.<br />
He'd told the poor old dear some gallant lies<br />
That she would nourish all her days, no doubt.<br />
For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes<br />
Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,<br />
Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy.<br />
<br />
He thought how "Jack," cold-footed, useless swine,<br />
Had panicked down the trench that night the mine<br />
Went up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried<br />
To get sent home; and how, at last, he died,<br />
Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care<br />
Except that lonely woman with white hair.<br />

<a id="BEFORE_THE_BATTLE"></a>BEFORE THE BATTLE<br />
<br />
<br />
Music of whispering trees<br />
Hushed by the broad-winged breeze<br />
Where shaken water gleams;<br />
And evening radiance falling<br />
With reedy bird-notes calling.<br />
O bear me safe through dark, you low-voiced streams.<br />
<br />
I have no need to pray<br />
That fear may pass away;<br />
I scorn the growl and rumble of the fight<br />
That summons me from cool<br />
Silence of marsh and pool,<br />
And yellow lilies islanded in light.<br />
O river of stars and shadows, lead me through the night.<br />

<a id="THE_ROAD"></a>THE ROAD<br />
<br />
<br />
The road is thronged with women; soldiers pass<br />
And halt, but never see them; yet they're here&mdash;<br />
A patient crowd along the sodden grass,<br />
Silent, worn out with waiting, sick with fear.<br />
The road goes crawling up a long hillside,<br />
All ruts and stones and sludge, and the emptied dregs<br />
Of battle thrown in heaps. Here where they died<br />
Are stretched big-bellied horses with stiff legs;<br />
And dead men, bloody-fingered from the fight,<br />
Stare up at caverned darkness winking white.<br />
<br />
You in the bomb-scorched kilt, poor sprawling Jock,<br />
You tottered here and fell, and stumbled on,<br />
Half dazed for want of sleep. No dream could mock<br />
Your reeling brain with comforts lost and gone.<br />
You did not feel her arms about your knees,<br />
Her blind caress, her lips upon your head:<br />
Too tired for thoughts of home and love and ease,<br />
The road would serve you well enough for bed.<br />

<a id="TWO_HUNDRED_YEARS_AFTER"></a>TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER<br />
<br />
<br />
Trudging by Corbie Ridge one winter's night,<br />
(Unless old, hearsay memories tricked his sight),<br />
Along the pallid edge of the quiet sky<br />
He watched a nosing lorry grinding on,<br />
And straggling files of men; when these were gone,<br />
A double limber and six mules went by,<br />
Hauling the rations up through ruts and mud<br />
To trench-lines digged two hundred years ago.<br />
Then darkness hid them with a rainy scud,<br />
And soon he saw the village lights below.<br />
<br />
But when he'd told his tale, an old man said<br />
That <i>he'd</i> seen soldiers pass along that hill;<br />

<br />
<br />
I<br />
<br />
Moonlight and dew-drenched blossom, and the scent<br />
Of summer gardens; these can bring you all<br />
Those dreams that in the starlit silence fall:<br />
Sweet songs are full of odours.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">While I went</span><br />
Last night in drizzling dusk along a lane,<br />
I passed a squalid farm; from byre and midden<br />
Came the rank smell that brought me once again<br />
A dream of war that in the past was hidden.<br />
<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
Up a disconsolate straggling village street<br />
I saw the tired troops trudge: I heard their feet.<br />
The cheery Q.M.S. was there to meet<br />
And guide our Company in ...<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">I watched them stumble</span><br />
Into some crazy hovel, too beat to grumble;<br />
Saw them file inward, slipping from their backs<br />
Rifles, equipment, packs.<br />
<br />
On filthy straw they sit in the gloom, each face<br />
Bowed to patched, sodden boots they must unlace,<br />
While the wind chills their sweat through chinks and cracks.<br />
<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
I'm looking at their blistered feet; young Jones<br />
Stares up at me, mud-splashed and white and jaded;<br />
Out of his eyes the morning light has faded.<br />
Old soldiers with three winters in their bones<br />
Puff their damp Woodbines, whistle, stretch their toes<br />
They can still grin at me, for each of 'em knows<br />
That I'm as tired as they are ... <br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Can they guess</span><br />
The secret burden that is always mine?&mdash;<br />
Pride in their courage; pity for their distress;<br />
And burning bitterness<br />
That I must take them to the accursed Line.<br />
<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
I cannot hear their voices, but I see<br />
Dim candles in the barn: they gulp their tea,<br />
And soon they'll sleep like logs. Ten miles away<br />
The battle winks and thuds in blundering strife.<br />
And I must lead them nearer, day by day,<br />
To the foul beast of war that bludgeons life.<br />

<a id="AT_CARNOY"></a>AT CARNOY<br />

<br />
Down in the hollow there's the whole Brigade<br />
Camped in four groups: through twilight falling slow<br />
I hear a sound of mouth-organs, ill-played,<br />
And murmur of voices, gruff, confused, and low.<br />
Crouched among thistle-tufts I've watched the glow<br />
Of a blurred orange sunset flare and fade;<br />
And I'm content. To-morrow we must go<br />
To take some cursèd Wood.... O world God made!<br />

"<i>Fall in! Now, get a move on!</i>" (Curse the rain.)<br />
We splash away along the straggling village,<br />
Out to the flat rich country green with June ...<br />
And sunset flares across wet crops and tillage,<br />
Blazing with splendour-patches. Harvest soon<br />
Up in the Line. "<i>Perhaps the War 'll be done</i><br />
<i>By Christmas-time. Keep smiling then, old son!</i>"<br />
<br />
Here's the Canal: it's dusk; we cross the bridge.<br />
"<i>Lead on there by platoons</i>." The Line's a-glare<br />
With shell-fire through the poplars; distant rattle<br />
Of rifles and machine-guns. "<i>Fritz is there!</i><br />
<i>Christ, ain't it lively, Sergeant? Is't a battle?</i>"<br />
More rain: the lightning blinks, and thunder rumbles.<br />
"There's overhead artillery," some chap grumbles.<br />
<br />
"<i>What's all this mob, by the cross-road?</i>" (The guides) ...<br />
"<i>Lead on with Number One</i>." (And off they go.)<br />
"<i>Three-minute intervals</i>." ... Poor blundering files,<br />
Sweating and blindly burdened; who's to know<br />
If death will catch them in those two dark miles?<br />
(More rain.) "<i>Lead on, Headquarters</i>." (That's the lot.)<br />

<br />
Groping along the tunnel, step by step,<br />
He winked his prying torch with patching glare<br />
From side to side, and sniffed the unwholesome air.<br />
<br />
Tins, boxes, bottles, shapes too vague to know,<br />
A mirror smashed, the mattress from a bed;<br />
And he, exploring fifty feet below<br />
The rosy gloom of battle overhead.<br />
<br />
Tripping, he grabbed the wall; saw some one lie<br />
Humped at his feet, half-hidden by a rug,<br />
And stooped to give the sleeper's arm a tug.<br />
"I'm looking for headquarters." No reply.<br />
"God blast your neck!" (For days he'd had no sleep,)<br />
"Get up and guide me through this stinking place."<br />
Savage, he kicked a soft, unanswering heap,<br />
And flashed his beam across the livid face<br />
Terribly glaring up, whose eyes yet wore<br />
Agony dying hard ten days before;<br />
And fists of fingers clutched a blackening wound.<br />
<br />
Alone he staggered on until he found<br />
Dawn's ghost that filtered down a shafted stair<br />
To the dazed, muttering creatures underground<br />
Who hear the boom of shells in muffled sound.<br />
At last, with sweat of horror in his hair,<br />
He climbed through darkness to the twilight air,<br />
Unloading hell behind him step by step.<br />

And my slow heart said, "You must kill; you must kill:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soldier, soldier, morning is red."</span><br />
<br />
On the shapes of the slain in their crumpled disgrace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I stared for a while through the thin cold rain....</span><br />
"O lad that I loved, there is rain on your face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And your eyes are blurred and sick like the plain."</span><br />
<br />
I stood with the Dead.... They were dead; they were dead;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart and my head beat a march of dismay:</span><br />

I  knew a simple soldier boy<br />
Who grinned at life in empty joy,<br />
Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,<br />
And whistled early with the lark.<br />
<br />
In winter trenches, cowed and glum<br />
With crumps and lice and lack of rum,<br />
He put a bullet through his brain.<br />
No one spoke of him again.<br />

At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun<br />
In the wild purple of the glowering sun<br />
Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud<br />
The menacing scarred slope; and, one by one,<br />
Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire.<br />
The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed<br />
With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear,<br />
Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.<br />
Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear,<br />
They leave their trenches, going over the top,<br />
While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,<br />
And hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,<br />
Flounders in mud. O Jesu, make it stop!<br />

<br />
We'd gained our first objective hours before<br />
While dawn broke like a face with blinking eyes,<br />
Pallid, unshaved ind thirsty, blind with smoke.<br />
Things seemed all light at first. We held their line,<br />
With bombers posted, Lewis guns well placed,<br />
And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.<br />
The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs<br />
High-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps<br />
And trunks, face downward in the sucking mud,<br />
Wallowed like trodden and bags loosely filled;<br />
And naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair,<br />
Bulged, clotted heads, slept in the plastering slime.<br />
And then the rain began,&mdash;the jolly old rain!<br />
<br />
A yawning soldier knelt against the bank,<br />
Staring across the morning blear with fog;<br />
He wondered when the Allemands would get busy;<br />
And then, of course, they start'd with five-nines<br />
Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud.<br />
Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst<br />
Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell,<br />
While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke.<br />
He crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear,<br />
Sick for escape,&mdash;loathing the strangled horror<br />
And butchered, frantic gestures of the dead.<br />
<br />
An officer came blundering down the trench:<br />
"Stand-to and man the fire-step!" On he went ...<br />
Gasping and bawling, "Fire-step ... counter-attack!"<br />
Then the haze lifted. Bombing on the right<br />
Down the old sap: machine-guns on the left;<br />
And stumbling figures looming out in front.<br />
"O Christ, they're coming at us!" Bullets spat,<br />
And he remembered his rifle ... rapid fire ...<br />
And started blazing wildly ... then a bang<br />
Crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out<br />
To grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked<br />
And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom,<br />
Lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans.<br />
Down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned,<br />
Bleeding to death. The counter-attack had failed.<br />

"<i>He'd never seen so many dead before</i>."<br />
They sprawled in yellow daylight while he swore<br />

Of bombs along what once had been a road.<br />
"<i>How peaceful are the dead</i>."<br />
Who put that silly gag in some one's head?<br />
<br />
"<i>He'd never seen so many dead before</i>."<br />
The lilting words danced up and down his brain,<br />
While corpses jumped and capered in the rain.<br />
No, no; hfc wouldn't count them any more ...<br />
The dead have done with pain:<br />
They've choked; they can't come back to life again.<br />
<br />
When Dick was killed last week he looked like that,<br />
Flapping along the fire-step like a fish,<br />
After the blazing crump had knocked him flat ...<br />

Lost in the swamp and welter of the pit,<br />
He flounders off the duck-boards; only he knows<br />
Each flash and spouting crash,&mdash;each instant lit<br />
When gloom reveals the streaming rain. He goes<br />
Heavily, blindly on. And, while he blunders,<br />
"Could anything be worse than this?"&mdash;he wonders,<br />
Remembering how he saw those Germans run,<br />
Screaming for mercy among the stumps of trees:<br />
Green-faced, they dodged and darted: there was one<br />
Livid with terror, clutching at his knees....<br />
Our chaps were sticking 'em like pigs.... "O hell!"<br />

He gripped the stretcher; stiffened; glared; and screamed,<br />
"O put my leg down, doctor, do!" (He'd got<br />

The ward grew dark; but he was still complaining,<br />
And calling out for "Dickie." "Curse the Wood!<br />
"It's time to go; O Christ, and what's the good?&mdash;<br />

To gobble their muffins and eggs.<br />
<br />
Does it matter?&mdash;losing your sight?...<br />
There's such splendid work for the blind;<br />
And people will always be kind,<br />
As you sit on the terrace remembering<br />
And turning your face to the light.<br />
<br />
Do they matter?&mdash;those dreams from the pit?...<br />
You can drink and forget and be glad,<br />
And people won't say that you're mad;<br />
For they'll know that you've fought for your country,<br />
And no one will worry a bit.<br />

No doubt they'll soon get well; the shock and strain<br />
Have caused their stammering, disconnected talk.<br />
Of course they're "longing to go out again,"&mdash;<br />
These boys with old, scared faces, learning to walk,<br />
They'll soon forget their haunted nights; their cowed<br />
Subjection to the ghosts of friends who died,&mdash;<br />
Their dreams that drip with murder; and they'll be proud<br />
Of glorious war that shatter'd all their pride ...<br />
Men who went out to battle, grim and glad;<br />
Children, with eyes that hate you, broken and mad.<br />

That changed us into soldiers; swing your bells<br />

What means this metal in windy belfries hung<br />

Whose tones are tuned for peace: with martial tongue<br />

Young Croesus went to pay his call<br />
On Colonel Sawbones, Caxton Hall:<br />
And, though his wound was healed and mended,<br />
He hoped he'd get his leave extended.<br />
<br />
The waiting-room was dark and bare.<br />
He eyed a neat-framed notice there<br />
Above the fireplace hung to show<br />
Disabled heroes where to go<br />
For arms and legs; with scale of price,<br />
And words of dignified advice<br />
How officers could get them free.<br />
<br />
Elbow or shoulder, hip or knee,&mdash;<br />
Two arms, two legs, though all were lost,<br />
They'd be restored him free of cost.<br />
<br />
Then a Girl-Guide looked in to say,<br />
"Will Captain Croesus come this way?"<br />

When I'm among a blaze of lights,<br />
With tawdry music and cigars<br />
And women dawdling through delights,<br />
And officers at cocktail bars,&mdash;<br />
Sometimes I think of garden nights<br />
And elm trees nodding at the stars.<br />
<br />
I dream of a small firelit room<br />
With yellow candles burning straight,<br />
And glowing pictures in the gloom,<br />
And kindly books that hold me late.<br />
Of things like these I love to think<br />
When I can never be alone:<br />
Then some one says, "Another drink?"&mdash;<br />
And turns my living heart to stone.<br />

<br />
He spins and burns and loves the air,<br />
And splits a skull to win my praise;<br />
But up the nobly marching days<br />
She glitters naked, cold and fair.<br />
<br />
Sweet Sister, grant your soldier this;<br />
That in good fury he may feel<br />
The body where he sets his heel<br />
Quail from your downward darting kiss.<br />

He primmed his loose red mouth, and leaned his head<br />
Against a sorrowing angel's breast, and said:<br />
"You'd think so much bereavement would have made<br />
Unusual big demands upon my trade.<br />
The War comes cruel hard on some poor folk&mdash;<br />
Unless the fighting, stops I'll soon be broke."<br />
<br />
He eyed the Cemetery across the road&mdash;<br />
"There's scores of bodies out abroad, this while,<br />
That should be here by rights; they little know'd<br />
How they'd get buried in such wretched style."<br />
<br />
I told him, with a sympathetic grin,<br />
That Germans boil dead soldiers down for fat;<br />
And he was horrified. "What shameful sin!<br />
O sir, that Christian men should come to that!"<br />

Propped on a stick he viewed the August weald;<br />
Squat orchard trees and oasts with painted cowls;<br />
A homely, tangled hedge, a corn-stooked field,<br />
With sound of barking dogs and farmyard fowls.<br />
<br />
And he'd come home again to find it more<br />
Desirable than ever it was before.<br />
How right it seemed that he should reach the span<br />
Of comfortable years allowed to man!<br />
<br />
Splendid to eat and sleep and choose a wife,<br />
Safe with his wound, a citizen of life.<br />
He hobbled blithely through the garden gate,<br />
And thought: "Thank God they had to amputate!"<br />

Well, how are things in Heaven? I wish you'd say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because I'd like to know that you're all right.</span><br />
Tell me, have you found everlasting day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or been sucked in by everlasting night?</span><br />
For when I shut my eyes your face shows plain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hear you make some cheery old remark&mdash;</span><br />
I can rebuild you in my brain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though you've gone out patrolling in the dark.</span><br />
<br />
You hated tours of trenches; you were proud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of nothing more than having good years to spend;</span><br />
Longed to get home and join the careless crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of chaps who work in peace with Time for friend.</span><br />
That's all washed out now. You're beyond the wire;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No earthly chance can send you crawling back;</span><br />
You've finished with machine-gun fire&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knocked over in a hopeless dud-attack.</span><br />
<br />
Somehow I always thought you'd get done in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because you were so desperate keen to live:</span><br />
You were all out to try and save your skin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well knowing how much the world had got to give.</span><br />
You joked at shells and talked the usual "shop,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stuck to your dirty job and did it fine:</span><br />
With "Jesus Christ! when <i>will</i> it stop?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three years.... It's hell unless we break their line."</span><br />
<br />
So when they told me you'd been left for dead<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Wounded and missing"&mdash;(That's the thing to do</span><br />

When I'm asleep, dreaming and lulled and warm,&mdash;<br />
They come, the homeless ones, the noiseless dead.<br />
While the dim charging breakers of the storm<br />
Bellow and drone and rumble overhead,<br />
Out of the gloom they gather about my bed.<br />
They whisper to my heart; their thoughts are mine.<br />
"Why are you here with all your watches ended?<br />
From Ypres to Frise we sought you in the Line."<br />
In bitter safety I awake, unfriended;<br />
And while the dawn begins with slashing rain<br />
I think of the Battalion in the mud.<br />

Are they not still your brothers through our blood?"<br />

I am banished from the patient men who fight.<br />
They smote my heart to pity, built my pride.<br />
Shoulder to aching shoulder, side by side,<br />
They trudged away from life's broad wealds of light.<br />
Their wrongs were mine; and ever in my sight<br />
They went arrayed in honour. But they died,&mdash;<br />
Not one by one: and mutinous I cried<br />
To those who sent them out into the night.<br />
<br />
The darkness tells how vainly I have striven<br />
To free them from the pit where they must dwell<br />
In outcast gloom convulsed and jagged and riven<br />
By grappling guns. Love drove me to rebel.<br />
Love drives me back to grope with them through hell;<br />
And in their tortured eyes I stand forgiven.<br />

The bronzed battalions of the stricken wood<br />

For battle's fruitless harvest, and the feud<br />
Of outraged men. Their lives are like the leaves<br />
Scattered in flocks of ruin, tossed and blown<br />
Along the westering furnace flaring red.<br />

When thoughts you've gagged all day come back to scare you;<br />
And it's been proved that soldiers don't go mad<br />
Unless they lose control of ugly thoughts<br />
That drive them out to jabber among the trees.<br />

With bucketsful of water to sluice the dark,<br />

Books; what a jolly company they are,<br />
Standing so quiet and patient on their shelves,<br />
Dressed in dim brown, and black, and white, and green<br />
And every kind of colour. Which will you read?<br />
Come on; O <i>do</i> read something; they're so wise.<br />
I tell you all the wisdom of the world<br />
Is waiting for you on those shelves; and yet<br />
You sit and gnaw your nails, and let your pipe out,<br />
And listen to the silence: on the ceiling<br />
There's one big, dizzy moth that bumps and flutters;<br />
And in the breathless air outside the house<br />
The garden waits for something that delays.<br />
There must be crowds of ghosts among the trees,&mdash;<br />
Not people killed in battle,&mdash;they're in France,&mdash;<br />
But horrible shapes in shrouds&mdash;old men who died<br />
Slow, natural deaths,&mdash;old men with ugly souls,<br />
Who wore their bodies out with nasty sins.<br />

His hand will be upon the mud-soaked reins;<br />
Hearing the saddle creak,<br />

Out of the twilight; over the grey-blue sand,<br />
Shoals of low-jargoning men drift inward to the sound,&mdash;<br />
The jangle and throb of a piano ... tum-ti-tum ...<br />
Drawn by a lamp, they come<br />
Out of the glimmering lines of their tents, over the shuffling sand.<br />
<br />
O sing us the sopgs, the songs of our own land,<br />
You warbling ladies in white.<br />
Dimness conceals the hunger in our faces,<br />
This wall of faces risen out of the night,<br />
These eyes that keep their memories of the places<br />
So long beyond their sight.<br />

Jaded and gay, the ladies sing; and the chap in brown<br />
Tilts his grey hat; jaunty and lean and pale,<br />
He rattles the keys... some actor-bloke from town...<br />

Stands mute; the boat heaves onward through the night.<br />

(To Robert Graves)<br />
<br />
<br />
I<br />
<br />
Here I'm sitting in the gloom<br />
Of my quiet attic room.<br />
France goes rolling all around,<br />
Fledged with forest May has crowned.<br />
And I puff my pipe, calm-hearted,<br />
Thinking how the fighting started,<br />
Wondering when we'll ever end it,<br />
Back to Hell with Kaiser send it,<br />
Gag the noise, pack up and go,<br />
Clockwork soldiers in a row.<br />
I've got better things to do<br />
Than to waste my time on you.<br />
<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
Robert, when I drowse to-night,<br />
Skirting lawns of sleep to chase<br />
Shifting dreams in mazy light,<br />
Somewhere then I'll see your face<br />
Turning back to bid me follow<br />
Where I wag my arms and hollo,<br />
Over hedges hasting after<br />
Crooked smile and baffling laughter,<br />
Running tireless, floating, leaping,<br />
Down your web-hung woods and valleys,<br />
Garden glooms and hornbeam alleys,<br />
Where the glowworm stars are peeping,<br />
Till I find you, quiet as stone<br />
On a hill-top all alone,<br />
Staring outward, gravely pondering<br />
Jumbled leagues of hillock-wandering.<br />
<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
You and I have walked together<br />
In the starving winter weather.<br />
We've been glad because we knew<br />
Time's too short and friends are few.<br />
We've been sad because we missed<br />
One whose yellow head was kissed<br />
By the gods, who thought about him<br />
Till they couldn't do without him.<br />
Now he's here again; I've seen<br />
Soldier David dressed in green,<br />
Standing in a wood that swings<br />
To the madrigal he sings.<br />
He's come back, all mirth and glory,<br />
Like the prince in a fairy story.<br />
Winter called him far away;<br />
Blossoms bring him home with May.<br />
<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
Well, I know you'll swear it's true<br />
That you found him decked in blue<br />
Striding up through morning-land<br />
With a cloud on either hand.<br />
Out in Wales, you'll say, he marches<br />
Arm-in-arm with oaks and larches;<br />
Hides all night in hilly nooks,<br />
Laughs at dawn in tumbling brooks.<br />
Yet, it's certain, here he teaches<br />
Outpost-schemes to groups of beeches.<br />
And I'm sure, as here I stand,<br />
That he shines through every land,<br />
That he sings in every place<br />
Where we're thinking of his face.<br />
<br />
<br />
V<br />
<br />
Robert, there's a war in France;<br />
Everywhere men bang and blunder,<br />
Sweat and swear and worship Chance,<br />
Creep and blink through cannon thunder.<br />
Rifles crack and bullets flick,<br />
Sing and hum like hornet-swarms.<br />
Bones are smashed and buried quick.<br />
Yet, through stunning battle storms,<br />
All the while I watch the spark<br />
Lit to guide me; for I know<br />
Dreams will triumph, though the dark<br />
Scowls above me where I go.<br />
<i>You</i> can hear me; <i>you</i> can mingle<br />
Radiant folly with my jingle.<br />
War's a joke for me and you<br />
While we know such dreams are true!<br />

Squire nagged and bullied till I went to fight<br />
(Under Lord Derby's scheme). I died in hell&mdash;<br />
(They called it Passchendaele); my wound was slight,<br />
And I was hobbling back, and then a shell<br />
Burst slick upon the duck-boards; so I fell<br />
Into the bottomless mud, and lost the light.<br />
<br />
In sermon-time, while Squire is in his pew,<br />
He gives my gilded name a thoughtful stare;<br />
For though low down upon the list, I'm there:<br />
"In proud and glorious memory"&mdash;that's my due.<br />
Two bleeding years I fought in France for Squire;<br />
I  suffered anguish that he's never guessed;<br />
Once I came home on leave; and then went west.<br />
What greater glory could a man desire?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="THE_DEATH-BED"></a>THE DEATH-BED<br />
<br />
<br />
He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped<br />
Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;<br />
Aqueous like floating rays of amber light,<br />
Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep,&mdash;<br />
Silence and safety; and his mortal shore<br />
Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.<br />
<br />
Some one was holding water to his mouth.<br />
He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped<br />
Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot<br />
The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.<br />
Water&mdash;calm, sliding green above the weir;<br />
Water&mdash;a sky-lit alley for his boat,<br />
Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers<br />
And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,<br />
He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.<br />
<br />
Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,<br />
Blowing the curtain to a glimmering curve.<br />
Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars<br />
Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;<br />
Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,<br />
Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.<br />
<br />
Rain; he could hear it rustling through the dark;<br />
Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;<br />
Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers<br />
That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps<br />
Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace<br />
Gently and slowly washing life away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">* * * * *</span><br />
<br />
He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain<br />
Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore<br />
His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.<br />
But some one was beside him; soon he lay<br />
Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.<br />
And Death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared.<br />
<br />
Light many lamps and gather round his bed.<br />
Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.<br />
Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.<br />
He's young; he hated war; how should he die<br />
When cruel old campaigners win safe through?<br />
<br />
But Death replied: "I choose him." So he went,<br />
And there was silence in the summer night;<br />
Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.<br />
Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<i>Have you forgotten yet?</i>...<br />
For the world's events have rumbled on since those gagged days,<br />
Like traffic checked awhile at the crossing of city ways:<br />
And the haunted gap in your mind has filled with thoughts that flow<br />
Like clouds in the lit heavens of life; and you're a man reprieved to go,<br />
Taking your peaceful share of Time, with joy to spare.<br />
<i>But the past is just the same,&mdash;and War's a bloody game</i>....<br />
<i>Have you forgotten yet?</i>...<br />
<i>Look down, and swear by the slain of the War that you'll never forget</i>.<br />
<br />
Do you remember the dark months you held the sector at Mametz,&mdash;<br />
The nights you watched and wired and dug and piled sandbags on parapets?<br />
Do you remember the rats; and the stench<br />
Of corpses rotting in front of the front-line trench,&mdash;<br />
And dawn coming, dirty-white, and chill with a hopeless rain?<br />
Do you ever stop and ask, "Is it all going to happen again?"<br />
<br />
Do you remember that hour of din before the attack,&mdash;<br />
And the anger, the blind compassion that seized and shook you then<br />
As you peered at the doomed and haggard faces of your men?<br />
Do you remember the stretcher-cases lurching back<br />
With dying eyes and lolling heads,&mdash;those ashen-grey<br />
Masks of the lads who once were keen and kind and gay?<br />
<br />
<i>Have you forgotten yet?</i>...<br />
<i>Look up, and swear by the green of the Spring that you'll never forget</i>.<br />
<br />

<a id="SONG-BOOKS_OF_THE_WAR"></a>SONG-BOOKS OF THE WAR<br />
<br />
<br />
In fifty years, when peace outshines<br />
Remembrance of the battle lines,<br />
Adventurous lads will sigh and cast<br />
Proud looks upon the plundered past.<br />
On summer morn or winter's night,<br />
Their hearts will kindle for the fight,<br />
Reading a snatch of soldier-song,<br />
Savage and jaunty, fierce and strong;<br />
And through the angry marching rhymes<br />
Of blind regret and haggard mirth,<br />
They'll envy us the dazzling times<br />
When sacrifice absolved our earth.<br />
<br />
Some ancient man with silver locks<br />
Will lift his weary face to say:<br />
"War was a fiend who stopped our clocks<br />
Although we met him grim and gay."<br />
And then he'll speak of Haig's last drive,<br />
Marvelling that any came alive<br />
Out of the shambles that men built<br />
And smashed, to cleanse the world of guilt.<br />
But the boys, with grin and sidelong glance,<br />
Will think, "Poor grandad's day is done."<br />
And dream of lads who fought in France<br />
and lived in time to share the fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="EVERYONE_SANG"></a>EVERYONE SANG<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone suddenly burst out singing;<br />
And I was filled with such delight<br />
As prisoned birds must find in freedom<br />
Winging wildly across the white<br />
Orchards and dark green fields; on; on; and out of sight.<br />
<br />
Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted,<br />
And beauty came like the setting sun.<br />
My heart was shaken with tears and horror<br />
Drifted away ... O but every one<br />
Was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.<br />
